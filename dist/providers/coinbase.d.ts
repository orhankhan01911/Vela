/**
 * Coinbase market-data provider, built from scratch on the public Exchange REST + WebSocket APIs
 * — no third-party SDK, no API key. Serves spot products (`BTC-USD`, `ETH-EUR`, …), paginates past the
 * 300-candle cap, aggregates timeframes Coinbase doesn't serve natively (e.g. `30`, `4h`) and
 * folds `W`/`M` from daily. Live ticks build a forming candle from the `ticker` stream (Coinbase
 * has no native kline stream), with a poll fallback.
 *
 * Trades: Coinbase trades cursor-walk back from the live tip (the `cb-after` header) with no
 * time-seek, so trade-derived depth is `'recent'` — live and recent windows reconstruct; older bars
 * are served empty rather than walked unbounded.
 *
 *   import { CoinbaseProvider } from 'vela/providers/coinbase';
 *   chart.data.registerProvider('coinbase', new CoinbaseProvider());
